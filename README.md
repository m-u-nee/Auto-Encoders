# Retrieval-Augmententation
Some code and projects to help learn and understand embeddings and RAG.

In mnist-autoencoder.ipynb, a simple feedfoward autoencoder is built, then the latent space is analyzed and some visualization is performed.

in mnist-variationalautoencoder, the same thing is done but with a VAE which is also sampled from.
